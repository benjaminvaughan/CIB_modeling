# Planck Cirrus Estimation
This is a program that is meant to simulate the Cirrus emission at a specified field using
parameters from fitting to the Planck GNILC-Dust-Maps in Planck 2015.

Note that due to the complicated fitting procedure used in Planck 2015 the maps created using the MBB have
an offset from the fact that in their analysis they correlated the fit with regions of H1.
